# Roadmap

## Stage

Workflow gates W1–W8 are committed. Phase A is in progress. Ledger ground truth is 1646 formulas, 0 mismatches. After `AVERAGE` returns an error inside its range, the KPI answer check is paint 0, shuffled 1222, edits 0, full 0, plus one exempt cell. The shuffled path is still open. Version on this branch: 1.2.0 (5).

## Headline numbers

Release, 2026-10-16, this Mac, after `TEXT`, KPI file: import 0.369 s, open 0.669 s, export 2.226 s, fingerprint 3.808 s, June scroll worst 0.127 s, one edit commit 0.003 s, edit to pixels 0.046 s (1452 cells). Ledger: open 3.783 s, one edit commit 0.142 s, edit to pixels 3.510 s (92 cells), scroll worst 0.684 s. Those timings were not re-run after the average-error fix. Paint-order answer check: 0 mismatches plus 1 exempt. Ledger ground truth: 1646 formulas, 0 mismatches.

## Progress log

- 2026-10-16 — `AVERAGE` and `AVERAGEIFS` return an error in the averaged cells. KPI answer check: paint 0, shuffled 1222, edits 0, full 0, plus 1 exempt. Release timings were not re-run.
- 2026-10-16 — Unqualified ranges stay on the sheet that owns the formula. KPI answer check: paint 2, shuffled 1224, edits 2, full 2, plus 1 exempt. Release timings were not re-run.
- 2026-10-16 — `TEXT` date and time codes use `ExcelFormatCode`. KPI answer check: paint 531, shuffled 1753, edits 531, full 2, plus 1 exempt. Release timings are in `docs/STATUS.md`.
- 2026-10-16 — Range reads calculate formula cells before the range is assembled. KPI answer check: paint 896, shuffled 2118, edits 896, full 367, plus 1 exempt. Release timings are in `docs/STATUS.md`.
- 2026-10-16 — Release timings after the W7 edit path, including edit to pixels. KPI edit to pixels 0.046 s (1452 cells). Ledger edit to pixels 3.281 s (92 cells). Numbers are in `docs/STATUS.md`.
- 2026-10-16 — W8: `ATTRIBUTION.md`, KPI-derived answer file removed, synthetic samples live under `Fixtures/`, `hero.png` is under 1 MB. `scripts/ci.sh` printed `PASS (215.3s)` with the private KPI check skipped. With the corpus set, KPI is still 48191 formulas, 367 mismatches, 1 exempt.
- 2026-10-15 — W7: view-model cell edits, paste, fill, structure changes, sort, and sheet add, rename, and delete go through `WorkbookSession.apply`. Document undo stays on `UndoManager`. Full gate still blocked by privacy and assets.
- 2026-10-15 — W6: `spark-grid-cli` eval, cat, recalc, check, bench, and run. Smoke: `eval '=ABS(-2)'` prints `2`. Full gate still blocked by privacy and assets.
- 2026-10-15 — W5: corpus manifest (hash only), ledger Python ground truth (1646 formulas, 0 mismatches), KPI saved-result check (48191 formulas, 367 mismatches, 1 exempt), fuzz smoke (seed 1, 20 steps, pass), unit tests for every present function. Full gate still blocked by privacy and assets.
- 2026-10-15 — W4: crash-rule violations removed, hostile-input caps added, recovery copy written after edits. SwiftLint and swift-format pass. Full gate still blocked by later stages.
- 2026-10-15 — W3: `scripts/ci.sh` is the commit gate. First run `FAIL (0.6s)` at SwiftLint 0.65.1 strict (13 violations). No full PASS.
- 2026-10-15 — W2: engine moved into `Packages/SparkGridCore` with nine layers. Layer check passed. Gate script still not built.
- 2026-10-15 — W1: agent rulebook, status, gaps, and function parity. Gate not built yet.
- 2026-10-15 — `2958120`: sheet switch returns before cross-sheet calc; save returns before the export write finishes. Viewport scroll and Find focus stay.
- 2026-10-11 — Performance rules and the older KPI baseline recorded on `main`.
