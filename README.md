# Spark Grid

Free native Mac spreadsheet for opening, editing, and saving `.xlsx` and CSV files. [Spark Grid 1.0 is on the Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spark-grid/id6811196983?mt=12). No account, no analytics, and the app does not use the network.

Site: https://sparkgridapp.com

Built with SwiftUI chrome and a custom AppKit grid.

**Version 1.0** is the Mac App Store release. It evaluates an everyday formula list, and it has filters, formatting, and pictures. Charts are not in that build. Pivot tables and SUMIF are not in this version. Rough edges are real; please report files that break.

## Requirements

- macOS 14+ (tested on macOS 27 Golden Gate)
- Xcode 27+ recommended to build against the macOS 27 SDK (older Xcode 16+ may still work for source builds)
- Apple Development / Distribution signing team

## Build & run

```bash
open "Spark Grid.xcodeproj"
```

Or:

```bash
DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer \
  xcodebuild -scheme "Spark Grid" -configuration Release -destination 'platform=macOS' build
```

## Features

- Spreadsheet grid: selection, fill handle, freeze panes, merges, zoom
- Formula bar with lexer/parser/evaluator and autocomplete
- Formatting toolbar, conditional formatting, AutoFilter, sort, find/replace
- Chart insertion exists in this source tree. It is not in the Mac App Store build. Drag to move, resize, custom series and point colors, and title, legend, axis, and gridline controls are not shipped.
- Embedded pictures (insert, move, resize, z-order)
- `.xlsx` / `.csv` open and save, with autosave for a file you have already saved

Finder’s Space preview does not open Spark Grid for `.csv` or `.xlsx`. macOS uses another app’s Quick Look generator for those types.

## App Store / signing notes

- Bundle ID: `com.sparkbysam.SparkGrid`
- Sandboxed; user-selected file access + printing
- No network features; encryption questionnaire: standard exemption (`ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption = false`)
- Privacy Nutrition Labels: data not collected (confirm in App Store Connect)

## Debug bug-bash

```bash
export SPARK_GRID_BUG_BASH=1
export SPARK_GRID_FIXTURES="/path/to/fixtures"   # optional; copy samples here for the sandboxed app
# formulas.xlsx, conditional_format.xlsx, enterprise_themed.xlsx, enterprise_images.xlsx
# bdc_kpi_ytd_layout.xlsx, BDC-Digital-KPI-2026.xlsx (KPI open-path test)
```

Missing fixtures are skipped.
